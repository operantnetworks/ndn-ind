/**
 * The Validator class provides an interface for validating data and interest
 * packets.
 *
 * Every time a validation process is initiated, it creates a ValidationState
 * that exists until the validation finishes with either success or failure.
 * This state serves several purposes:
 * to record the Interest or Data packet being validated,
 * to record the failure callback,
 * to record certificates in the certification chain for the Interest or Data
 * packet being validated,
 * to record the names of the requested certificates in order to detect loops in
 * the certificate chain,
 * and to keep track of the validation chain size (also known as the validation
 * "depth").
 *
 * During validation, the policy and/or key fetcher can augment the validation
 * state with policy- and fetcher-specific information using tags.
 *
 * A Validator has a trust anchor cache to save static and dynamic trust
 * anchors, a verified certificate cache for saving certificates that are
 * already verified, and an unverified certificate cache for saving pre-fetched
 * but not yet verified certificates.
